# GUI-Solar-radiation-prediction
We created a graphic user interface that displays a solar panel's energy consumption based on predictive algorithms for solar radiation, inspired by the competition "You are my sunshine" organized by the NASA innovation hub. 
The main objetvive is to develop a product that allows people to understand the performance of a solar panel. 
I was in charge of developing the GUI using Python's package tkinter. 
The result was an expanding window containg labels, buttons, entry boxes, option menus, and a progress bar. 
The images explaining the final product can be found in the Report.
